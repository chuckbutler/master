# Flannel Charm Layer

A minimal layer intended to be "mixed in" with the [Docker Layer](http://github.com/juju-solutions/layer-docker)
to provide Flannel based Overlay Networking to Docker Container infrastructure

This will probably go away into a more generic libnetwork abstraction when
docker 1.9 launches.
